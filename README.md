# rsd_metric
Simulate the random serial dictatorship algorithm for bipartite graphs in a metric space.

## search.py
Generate random bipartite graphs in metric space, and simulate the RSD algorithm to estimate approximation ratio.

## verify.py
Run RSD simulation for 100000 rounds on a single example to have a better estimation of the approxiamtion ratio.

## example_50.txt
An example of size 50 that the RSD simulation gives an estimation of 2.03-approximation.
